# Monthly Trends

A web app that queries Google Trends and displays the data broken down by month, which is way more useful than by week.

Current limitations:
- Trends queries are limited to search term comparisons.
- Geo-targeting is limited to worldwide, Australia, and New Zealand, because that's mostly what I and my team look at in Google Trends.
