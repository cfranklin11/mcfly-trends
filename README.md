# McFly Trends

A web app that queries Google Trends and displays the data broken down by month, which is way more useful than by week.

Current limitations (all due to laziness rather than technical issues):
- Trends queries are limited to search term comparisons.
- Geo-targeting is limited to worldwide, Australia, and New Zealand, because that's mostly what I and my team look at in Google Trends.
- No support for categories.
- Web Search only.
